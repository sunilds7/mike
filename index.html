                        <p> Hi my name is Sunil Dev Singh, I am a student actively pursuing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university. My student number is s3874626 and my student email address is s3874626@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently residing in Malaysia which is my motherland, and anticipating my arrival to Melbourne, Australia to begin with physical classes. I began my primary education in a government school learning the local syllabus between 2008 – 2013. It was then, my parents opted to switch me to an internationally recognized syllabus known as IGCSE for my secondary education from 2014-2018. Having graduated, I joined a Monash university foundation program at Sunway university during 2019, followed by my arrival to RMIT university. On a separate note, my first language has always been English followed by Bahasa Melayu which is the national language of Malaysia. Throughout Malaysia’s conditional movement restriction order, I developed a pretty handy skill. I learned how to cook! It might not sound glamourous but it does save me a lot of money. Besides that, my favourite hobby is playing football. I have represented many teams and travelled to many countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore to play football. Above all, my greatest takeaway was getting to meet so many diverse individuals around the world through a beautiful sport. </p>

                <h3>IT Interests</h3>
                <p>A major interest of mine in IT is Artificial intelligence. My passion for IT began when I was enrolled in computing skills classes as a child. In those classes, the teacher always made it interactive and fun while creating a healthy learning environment. I started to look forward to computing classes as it was always a platform where I could express my creativity and skills in the assignments. Scratch was one of my favourite platforms because it taught me simple programming while giving me the access to play the games or applications I created. I was also introduced to Microsoft excel. As I got older, I approached my teacher and he gave me valuable insights on the importance of IT and the job scope in today’s job market. Having considered, my passion and demand for AI in the mainstream market, it was a no-brainer for me to pursue an IT degree. Moving on, when I graduated from my foundation program and looking for a university to pursue my degree. Rmit university appealed the most to me because it consists of a recognized IT program and has a great student support system. Furthermore, the university is very diverse.  My sister is currently a second-year computer science student at RMIT and she too recommended me to pursue my degree there as she mentioned that the classes are informative and impressive. My aim for this course is to further my understanding on networking, any programming software and artificial intelligence. Overall enhancing my knowledge, in which allowing me to broaden my options when applying for a job to broadcast my flexibility.</p>

                <h3>My Project idea</h3>
                <p>I plan to create a fitness application that would be useful for users ranging from beginners to highly trained athletes. This application would include workout modules, diet and nutrition tips and specific activity tracking skills. This application allows you to store your personal data, allowing you to monitor your progress overtime. Health and fitness has always been mentioned to us from a young age, however the steps and skills to attain an ideal fitness level has always been a grey area. With this application, I believe it would help elevate us individuals to a longer and healthier lifestyle. The access of this application would be one tap away however the effects of following the routine of this application would be life-changing.</p>
            <br>
                <p>According to World Health Organization (WHO), 1.4 billion adults as the study evaluates do not get enough exercise on a weekly basis, which could lead to severe health problems in the near future. This could be because many people are too busy working and can’t afford the time and money to travel to the nearest gym and spend their money on a pricy monthly subscription. Although, I am of the opinion that not all of these adults are willing to switch to a healthier lifestyle immediately, over 50% of mobile phone users in the US have downloaded at least one fitness app. Thus, I strongly believe that there is a huge untapped market for fitness applications in the world. My fitness application would be convenient for users because it would be free for the basic fitness features and provide the users the option to pay for the premium feature to further exhibit their results in the long run. The free feature would allow the user to experiment with the application and provide the user on the key insights and evaluations of the results proposed while keeping the user captivated. In comparison, my fitness application would be significantly cheaper as opposed to a personal trainer while providing equally good results. Furthermore, according to the World Health Organisation (2016), there are around 2 billion adults overweight, of those 650 million are considered to be affected by obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²). Some of the factors that may prevent these individuals from losing weight, include the anxiety of working out in public and the lack of understanding of the importance of a healthy diet in weight loss. My application would eliminate any form of anxiety faced from these people as they have the ability to workout from the comfort of their own homes. This could provide them more motivation to improve themselves as they are still within their comfort zones. Besides, the application also shares important diet and nutrition tips while keeping the food tasty and scrumptious. Thus, broadening the stereotype that tasty food is often unhealthy. As the popular adage goes ‘The conscious choice you make everyday lay the foundation for your mental and physical health and also determine the quality of life you lead’.</p>
      <br>
                <p>The initial feature after downloading the application is the sign up and log in. This provides the user the option to create a new personal account. The user would then have to select their targets and goals that they aim to achieve using the application. Through logging in with a personal account, it allows the application to create a more targeted and relevant fitness scheme after having specific information such as age, gender, weight and height revealed. In which allowing the application to already calculate the current Body mass index (BMI). From this calculation a mildly specific diet plan would be provided to the user having compared the BMI index to the user’s specific goals and targets. In addition, this application would allow multi-device synchronization. This feature would allow wearable products such as the IWatch and Fitbit to download this application. Thus, allowing users to constantly monitor their heart rates. Incorporating Multi-device synchronization would also permit the application to integrate geolocation allowing users to monitor their routes and planning their future routes while staying true to the original workout plan for a period of 6 months using only the base application. I strongly believe that after the period of 6 months, users would switch to the premium features as they would feel satisfied with the application and not want to lose track of all their current stored data. Not only is this beneficial for tracking your workout but this could also serve as a motivational boost. Moreover, the notification and reminder feature are essential in my application. As many people often suffer from the hustle and bustle of a busy life and tend to forget about their workout session. In such situations, the notification and reminder feature can be very useful. Lastly, the basic feature would include a tips box that allows user to share their advice on how I could make this application more appealing to them. Thus, enhancing the user experience. Having mentioned all of the basic features of the application, allow me to share the premium features for this application. Using the premium application, users would now be able to access more educational content and video tutorials. These videos may include how to develop a better mindset before and after a workout, unique techniques that should be used when approaching a more difficult workout and suggested meditation techniques for beginners. The following feature is a sleep tracker. To use this, feature the user must actively use their fitness tracker wearable for the application to monitor their heartrate and breathing rate. Next, is a water tracker. Water is as essential but neglected part of our diet. The water tracker would serve as a push notification reminder to constantly remind the user the consume it. The premium feature allows users to set the reminders as to their liking compared to the basic features which have a set time. Adding to this, in the premium feature gamification is incorporated to create more motivation and prevent the user from quitting their workout plan as the user would be rewarded with badges and rewards. Encouraging the user to work harder to win more awards in a form of healthy competition. Lastly, the premium feature allows users to share their results through integrating the application with social media. This allows the users to broadcast their amazing fitness journeys with great data and charts of their results while simultaneously advertising the application.</p>
       <br>
                <p>The tools required to create this application is Java and Oracle. Java would be the ideal software for me to create this application as I am most familiar to this programming language. Java is commonly used for banking application too. This is because Java is known to be safe, portable, maintainable and comes with better high-level concurrency tools than C++ or any other language. On the other hand, Oracle will be used to store and retrieve user’s information. High profile companies such as US cellular user oracle because its portability is rather great, superb backup and recovery while still being cost effective. Using oracle, the application would be able to store user’s confidential data and progress over an extended period of time while still maintaining its privacy. 
           <br>
                    <p>An essential skill required to expand my business is high proficiency in Java. With a high proficiency in Java, I would be able create a better user experience, overall ensuring the user’s commitment to the application. A majority part of the programming would be dedicated to ensure that the target and goals of this user matches the training modules. The training would be listed clearly and concisely to allow the user to have a better understanding of the assigned workouts. Therefore, if my application thrives in the market, I could then hire a group of software developers to work alongside me in adding new and improved features</p>

                <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
                <p>My ideal job is to be an Automation Engineer. An Automation engineer can be derived as someone who utilizes technology to improve, streamline and automate a manufacturing process. Hence, the IT job I selected is an Automation Engineer at Bayside Personell in Melbourne, Australia. This job fascinated me because it would make the most of my future qualifications and abilities having completed my bachelor degree of IT and an opportunity to constantly challenge myself by keeping updated to the latest artificial intelligence technology available. This job also carries a satisfying estimated annual salary of $120 thousand, that would encourage me to work at my best while allowing me to travel around the world. The important skills and knowledge required to be able to apply for this job is to have a bachelor degree in IT, computer science, engineering or any related field. Followed by, by a minimum of 3 years AI-related coding experience or an example of demonstrated AI-projects done throughout university study, which must be coded by python. Although, different AI applications and dashboard development are highly rated. Examples illustrating high innovative thinking is a strong factor when taken into consideration for this job. Some of the key characteristics that are suited with this job are a process driven approach, strong attention to detail and machine learning experience. Ultimately, leading up to the candidate to being able to work as a team during Process Innovation Projects and have good communication skills, by contributing ideas on discussions about AI with business owners. Finally, coding successful AI modules ready for deployment. Some of my prior skills for this job include my robotic competition experiences which highlight my high-innovative thinking skills in a limited time while under pressure. These robotics competitions, often took place over a period of months and were mostly groupwork. Therefore, illustrating my ability to work as a team to strive for the same goal and delegate tasks to each other over a long period of time and maintaining a productive space within the group. However, allow me to share my insights on how I wish to obtain the skills, qualifications and experiences that I do not have or wish to strengthen for this position as an automation engineer. Firstly, I am already pursuing a bachelor degree in IT which entails the usage of python. I am going to ensure I work harder and smarter on my projects and assignments using python as it is detrimental to broadcast my ability in the Artificial Intelligence field. Furthermore, I am going to take initiative to study other programming languages by allocating 3 hours a week consistently as It would be beneficial when companies compare my resume to others. Finally, I am going to join more robotics competitions in Melbourne, as it would increase my thinking skills and provide unique ideas when starting my working life. </p>

                <h3>Personal profile</h3>
                <p>Considering these results from the various personality tests, I am of the opinion that I would be a team-player in the group and attempt to get everyone to play their part so that we would all strive further in achieving our shared goal in the group. I believe my enthusiasm and willingness to compromise would allow me to encourage a more productive working environment as it could elevate my performance by feeling more comfortable with sharing ideas while having a constant reminder to work harder. When forming a team, it is essential that my groupmates are like-minded and hardworking. I believe that being hardworking is the bare minimum required in an individual when joining a group. Emphasizing on the word ‘TEAM’ – Together Everyone Achieves More. Ultimately, my team should be friendly and willing to accept different ideas, as it would result in more innovative ideas for the group.</p>

				<p>  I partially agree to the personality traits described such as being an intuitive person and making decisions based on my feelings and logic. I do also agree to being extroverted at times when I feel comfortable in my environment. However, I strongly disagree with being assertive. As I have always valued myself by chasing my dreams and goals. I firmly believe that, anything is possible, as long as I commit fully and give a 100 percent in achieving it.</p>

						 <p> The Pragmatist style was described best to suit my learning skills. I concur with this description because I have always attempted to link what I have learned into the real world as it enhances my level of understanding towards the topic. However, it is also true that I tend to lose interest in a topic after revisiting it multiple times. I have always loved exploring new ideas and learning about various topics to increase my general knowledge. In my opinion, the activist and pragmatist approach combined both compliment my learning style.</p>

							<p> Although my agreeableness is the highest scoring percentile in the big five personality test, I tend to always voice out my opinions on matters, should it contribute to the discussion whether it may be opposing views. I believe that the best discussions should be straight-forward and carry opposing views to narrow the best possible solutions to the problems faced. </p>
