                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p> Hi my name is Sunil Dev Singh, I am a student actively pursuing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university. My student number is s3874626 and my student email address is s3874626@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently residing in Malaysia which is my motherland, and anticipating my arrival to Melbourne, Australia to begin with physical classes. I began my primary education in a government school learning the local syllabus between 2008 – 2013. It was then, my parents opted to switch me to an internationally recognized syllabus known as IGCSE for my secondary education from 2014-2018. Having graduated, I joined a Monash university foundation program at Sunway university during 2019, followed by my arrival to RMIT university. On a separate note, my first language has always been English followed by Bahasa Melayu which is the national language of Malaysia. Throughout Malaysia’s conditional movement restriction order, I developed a pretty handy skill. I learned how to cook! It might not sound glamourous but it does save me a lot of money. Besides that, my favourite hobby is playing football. I have represented many teams and travelled to many countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore to play football. Above all, my greatest takeaway was getting to meet so many diverse individuals around the world through a beautiful sport. </p>

                <h3>IT and other Interests</h3>
                <p>A major interest of mine in IT is Artificial intelligence. My passion for IT began when I was enrolled in computing skills classes as a child. In those classes, the teacher always made it interactive and fun while creating a healthy learning environment. I started to look forward to computing classes as it was always a platform where I could express my creativity and skills in the assignments. Scratch was one of my favourite platforms because it taught me simple programming while giving me the access to play the games or applications I created. I was also introduced to Microsoft excel. As I got older, I approached my teacher and he gave me valuable insights on the importance of IT and the job scope in today’s job market. Having considered, my passion and demand for AI in the mainstream market, it was a no-brainer for me to pursue an IT degree. Moving on, when I graduated from my foundation program and looking for a university to pursue my degree. Rmit university appealed the most to me because it consists of a recognized IT program and has a great student support system. Furthermore, the university is very diverse.  My sister is currently a second-year computer science student at RMIT and she too recommended me to pursue my degree there as she mentioned that the classes are informative and impressive. My aim for this course is to further my understanding on networking, any programming software and artificial intelligence. Overall enhancing my knowledge, in which allowing me to broaden my options when applying for a job to broadcast my flexibility.</p>

                <h3>My Project idea</h3>
                <p>I plan to create a fitness application that would be useful for users ranging from beginners to highly trained athletes. This application would include workout modules, diet and nutrition tips and specific activity tracking skills. This application allows you to store your personal data, allowing you to monitor your progress overtime. Health and fitness has always been mentioned to us from a young age, however the steps and skills to attain an ideal fitness level has always been a grey area. With this application, I believe it would help elevate us individuals to a longer and healthier lifestyle. The access of this application would be one tap away however the effects of following the routine of this application would be life-changing.</p>

                <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
                <p>My ideal job is to be an Automation Engineer. An Automation engineer can be derived as someone who utilizes technology to improve, streamline and automate a manufacturing process. Hence, the IT job I selected is an Automation Engineer at Bayside Personell in Melbourne, Australia. This job fascinated me because it would make the most of my future qualifications and abilities having completed my bachelor degree of IT and an opportunity to constantly challenge myself by keeping updated to the latest artificial intelligence technology available. This job also carries a satisfying estimated annual salary of $120 thousand, that would encourage me to work at my best while allowing me to travel around the world. The important skills and knowledge required to be able to apply for this job is to have a bachelor degree in IT, computer science, engineering or any related field. Followed by, by a minimum of 3 years AI-related coding experience or an example of demonstrated AI-projects done throughout university study, which must be coded by python. Although, different AI applications and dashboard development are highly rated. Examples illustrating high innovative thinking is a strong factor when taken into consideration for this job. Some of the key characteristics that are suited with this job are a process driven approach, strong attention to detail and machine learning experience. Ultimately, leading up to the candidate to being able to work as a team during Process Innovation Projects and have good communication skills, by contributing ideas on discussions about AI with business owners. Finally, coding successful AI modules ready for deployment. Some of my prior skills for this job include my robotic competition experiences which highlight my high-innovative thinking skills in a limited time while under pressure. These robotics competitions, often took place over a period of months and were mostly groupwork. Therefore, illustrating my ability to work as a team to strive for the same goal and delegate tasks to each other over a long period of time and maintaining a productive space within the group. However, allow me to share my insights on how I wish to obtain the skills, qualifications and experiences that I do not have or wish to strengthen for this position as an automation engineer. Firstly, I am already pursuing a bachelor degree in IT which entails the usage of python. I am going to ensure I work harder and smarter on my projects and assignments using python as it is detrimental to broadcast my ability in the Artificial Intelligence field. Furthermore, I am going to take initiative to study other programming languages by allocating 3 hours a week consistently as It would be beneficial when companies compare my resume to others. Finally, I am going to join more robotics competitions in Melbourne, as it would increase my thinking skills and provide unique ideas when starting my working life. </p>

                <h3>Personal profile</h3>
                <p>Considering these results from the various personality tests, I am of the opinion that I would be a team-player in the group and attempt to get everyone to play their part so that we would all strive further in achieving our shared goal in the group. I believe my enthusiasm and willingness to compromise would allow me to encourage a more productive working environment as it could elevate my performance by feeling more comfortable with sharing ideas while having a constant reminder to work harder. When forming a team, it is essential that my groupmates are like-minded and hardworking. I believe that being hardworking is the bare minimum required in an individual when joining a group. Emphasizing on the word ‘TEAM’ – Together Everyone Achieves More. Ultimately, my team should be friendly and willing to accept different ideas, as it would result in more innovative ideas for the group.</p>

				<p>  I partially agree to the personality traits described such as being an intuitive person and making decisions based on my feelings and logic. I do also agree to being extroverted at times when I feel comfortable in my environment. However, I strongly disagree with being assertive. As I have always valued myself by chasing my dreams and goals. I firmly believe that, anything is possible, as long as I commit fully and give a 100 percent in achieving it.</p>

						 <p> The Pragmatist style was described best to suit my learning skills. I concur with this description because I have always attempted to link what I have learned into the real world as it enhances my level of understanding towards the topic. However, it is also true that I tend to lose interest in a topic after revisiting it multiple times. I have always loved exploring new ideas and learning about various topics to increase my general knowledge. In my opinion, the activist and pragmatist approach combined both compliment my learning style.</p>

							<p> Although my agreeableness is the highest scoring percentile in the big five personality test, I tend to always voice out my opinions on matters, should it contribute to the discussion whether it may be opposing views. I believe that the best discussions should be straight-forward and carry opposing views to narrow the best possible solutions to the problems faced. </p>
